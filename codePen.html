            <h1>CodePen Challenges</h1>
            <p><a href="https://codepen.io/DomDuliepre/pen/WKePvW">VeryEasy.html</a> - This assignment required an unordered list that mentioned the colors of the rainbow. It wasn't that difficult to create, hence the file name "VeryEasy".</p>
            <p><a href="https://codepen.io/DomDuliepre/pen/gjYqPd">Easy.html</a> - This assignment required an <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> page with a main headline, two subheads in their own sections and supporting text for each subhead. Free to choose our own topic for the website, I chose to focus the website about the two things that make up the Marvel Universe. That included superheroes and villains.</p>
            <p><a href="https://codepen.io/DomDuliepre/pen/ZjzwWb">Medium.html</a> - This assignment required an HTML page that was fully semantic. Focusing on a different topic was also another requirement so the website wouldn't be repeated, so I decided to make an <abbr title="Rhythm &amp; Blues">R&amp;B</abbr> Website. It included various links to different R&amp;B Artists.</p>
            <p><a href="https://codepen.io/DomDuliepre/pen/jpNdqg">Hard.html</a> - This assignment required an HTML form that would collect different information like name, gender, favorite sport, and what toppings you like on your website.</p>
            <p><a href="https://codepen.io/DomDuliepre/pen/VBZgjQ">VeryHard1.html</a> - This assignment required me to get some help from some really nice peers. Creating the horizontal navigation and making one of the items be a dropdown navigation really stumped me.</p>
            <p><a href="https://codepen.io/DomDuliepre/pen/yqBZaN">VeryHard2.html</a> - This assignment was the hardest challenge of the week. It was on Javascript, which I haven't learned yet. Good thing there are a lot of people at RedVentures willing to help.</p>
